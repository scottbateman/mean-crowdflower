  title: 'Help us find people looking to buy, sell, or rent a home.',
  instructions:  '<b>NOTE: We frequently update our instructions and job structure to try and make things clearer for you. Please read through before each job to make sure we haven\'t changed anything significant.</b>\n\n<h4>We are using Twitter to try to find people who are looking to buy, sell, or rent a home.</h4>\n\nWe find many tweets mentioning “homes” or “moving”, but figuring out if someone has a serious interest can be a challenge. Grasping humour, sarcasm, and wish-full thinking becomes even more difficult thanks to the 140 character limit. On top of this, Twitter users are not required to show their name, gender, age, or location–all of which are valuable clues as to how genuine someone’s interest may be. \n\n<h4>Your job</h4>\nYou will be shown a series of Twitter messages, and it is your job to determine if this person, or someone they know, has a genuine interest in buying, selling, or renting a home. Just as important is knowing whether or not this is a realistic interest. For example, people who want to move but do not have the resources. In order to figure out if someone\'s interest is genuine and realistic you must go beyond the Tweet itself and look at the user’s description, pictures, and recent messages. Use these resources and your intuition to try and get a sense of who the person is before making your judgment.\n\n<h3>Check the following for each Tweet:</h3>\n\n<div class="list-group">\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">1</span> Display Picture</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nKeep in mind, many people put photos of themselves as their display picture but this is not always the case. It is not uncommon for teenagers to put pictures of their favourite celebrity as their profile picture. If the photo looks to be of high quality it may have been taken from somewhere\'s else.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">2</span> Description</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nAlthough user descriptions are often left blank, or contain only trivial statements, they sometimes provide valuable information. Some users put things like their birthday, job, or interests in here. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">3</span> Recent Messages</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nLooking at a user’s recent messages can give you a good idea of where they are in life. A quick scan over someone’s last 25-50 tweets will help give you a much better idea of who they are. Some people post meaningless statements, others try to engage in thoughtful conversation. The content they post says something about them as a person, so make sure to listen.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">4</span> Recent Pictures</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nAs with messages, pictures and videos may contain clues to a person’s identity. Watch for picture’s of their home, friends, family, and any events they have attended. Some younger users will post a lot of pictures of their celebrity crushes, which can be confusing when you have never heard of these people.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">5</span> The Conversation</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nAfter having looked at each of these things, go back to the Tweet and click on it’s date to see the conversation it was a part of. This added context will help make the meaning of the message clear.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class="list-group-item">\n<h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><span class="label label-info">6</span> The Tweet</h4>\n<p class="list-group-item-text">\nExamine the tweet carefully, keeping in mind everything you\'ve seen so far, and try to determine whether or not someone has a genuine and realistic interest in buying, selling, or renting a home. Pay close attention to the choice of words. Look for Tweets that talking about specifics of who, when, and where. "I\'m saving up to buy a house in Dalas next summer" is a more likely to be a genuine tweet then one that says something like "Alright, I\'m moving ASAP."\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h2> Examples</h2>\n<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">\n  <div class="panel panel-default">\n    <div class="panel-heading">\n      <h4 class="panel-title">\n        <button type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne">\n  Advertisement\n</button>\n      </h4>\n    </div>\n    <div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">\n      <div class="panel-body">\n        This is a good example of a hidden advertisement.\n<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1mN2EMM.png">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="panel panel-default">\n    <div class="panel-heading">\n      <h4 class="panel-title">\n        <button type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo">\n  Finished looking\n</button>\n      </h4>\n    </div>\n    <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">\n      <div class="panel-body">\n        In this example, someone has said they are moving \'today\'. We are only interested in finding people who are looking to buy, sell, or rent a home. Because this person is moving in today it sounds like they have already found their new place.\n<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vX9d0xD.png">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="panel panel-default">\n    <div class="panel-heading">\n      <button type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree">\n  Humour\n</button>\n    </div>\n    <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">\n      <div class="panel-body">\nThis is an example of a tweet where the user is both serious and joking. He actually wants to find a place to live, but he\'s telling everyone through a joke.\n        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/djt3p2b.png">\n        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ILiATdj.png">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>',
